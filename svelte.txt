1. Introduction

- framework that compile the code before we ship it
- small in size, fast, simple, less code
- VSCode extensions: Svelte, Svelte Intellisense, Svelte 3 Snippets
- Fontawesome inject in public folder
- ES6 import and export
- CSS scoped locally, not like in React
- CSS variables -> var(--primaryColor) !!! Thing to improve to Shivani Center project !!!
- :global(span) -> add css global
- #each in Svelte, map() in React
- for Accesibility for fontawesome use aria-label or aria-name -> screen readers
- props, dispatch event, setContext & getContext, store, fail
- props drilling -> pass props deep to nested components
- filter() returns a new array
- Svelte update:  () => removeSomething(id)  can be used like removeSomething(id)
- setContext & getContext (video 27) 
			   -> easily pass data for parent component to child component
			   -> better that props drilling, because we can omit the middle components passing
			   -> similar with Context API of React  
			   -> if we pass more data, we can set a state object with setContext
- createEventDispatcher -> pass data from child components to parent components
			-> not the prefered method, better use Store or setContext-getContext
- Reactivity -> $:variable -> don't neet to add let
- reduce()
- Two Way binding ->  great in Svelte
